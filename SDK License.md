### **2. Grant of Copyright License.**

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work in Runtime form.
